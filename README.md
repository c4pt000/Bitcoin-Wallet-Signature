	 Tracking stolen wallet.dat by unique signature id hard coded into the wallet.dat, if wallet.dat files were generated with a tracking id or a signature to be able to identify stolen wallet.dat for tracking purposes. Thinking if there was a way for snort IDS or any major modern type of IDS to detect wallet.dat being moved through a network to stop it from being transmitted out to protect wallet.dat also as a type of IDS "snort" / "suricata" rule set but if wallet.dat also had a type of unique signature when it is generated it might be able to be identified to track down stolen money. If it moves outside of a box somewhere else in an authorized fashion it doesn't really require appending to the existing functionality of the network maybe only through the wallet core client other types of alternatives wallets could adapt like electrum , etc that when wallet.dat is generated on a first start a type of unique signature is hardcoded into the wallet.dat file that cant be stripped out like hardcoded hex maybe like a unique 16 or 20 digit string like a credit card or a 20 digit e-money string  similar to that but a unique wallet.dat signature could be a 20 digit alphanumeric string or 30 digit alphanumeric string  not for import or receiving deposits but to be able to locate it if its stolen a certain way  because if funds of X amount were moved by a decimal it could possibly detect how a wallet was emptied by X amount to the decimal from a starting unique signature to how it moved to another unique signature from someone stealing funds and to be able to decipher false positives it could be determined the likely-hood of how coincidental two exact X amount by the decimal are if the funds were stolen in an elaborate way from someone using bitcoin. bitcoin can still be an anonymous way to send and receive money but if someone had to identify how bitcoin was stolen and traveled out of a wallet a unique signature would help identify a bitcoin wallet when someone felt they had to try and reacquire stolen bitcoin depending on whats involved.
